In this Project, I have used vanilla Viterbi as well as modified version of the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words. Determining correctly the PoS tags for unknown words happens arbitrarily in Vanilla Viterbi and this results in reduced accuracy. The idea is to develop different approaches to improve the accuracy while determining POS tags for unknown words.

The modified version of Viterbi includes three approaches explained in the code in comments, along with respective approach's accuracies on the test data.
