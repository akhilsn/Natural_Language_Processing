In this project, I have used web scraping and text processing for 13F and 10K data to find various points of interest and insights that can help in better asset management strategies.

13F Filing - Form 13F is a quarterly report filed, per United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, by "institutional investment managers" with control over $100M in assets to the SEC, listing all equity assets under management.

10K Filing - A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
