Predicting Stock market behavior is a hot topic among the NLP researchers. RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs have proven greatly efficient when dealing with Sequential data. But it turns out that other than RNNs, CNNs too are really effective in extracting features from the text. Although, we can directly feed text to an RNN but there are cases when the sequences are really long which makes it harder to use RNN since they're computationally expensive. <br><br>
**In this project, we have used 1D CNN-RNN architecture. The original work behind using 1D CNNs with RNNs was proposed in this paper titled "Combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis of Short Texts".**
